We have a casual dress code that allows employees to express themselves as individuals and which fosters a creative and free-thinking approach to problem solving and business solutions. And it also allows us to wear hoodies and shorts during internal meetings.
Flexible work schedules and all positions allowing for either entirely remote or hybrid working arrangements create a deeply rewarding work-life balance.
With flexible work schedules, employees can attend to personal matters, such as stepping away to pick up their children from school or to get a much-needed haircut.
In a recent internal survey, 89% of staff cited work-life balance as being one of the most rewarding aspects of working at Aprimo!
Part of the key to our success is that team members are not only successful at collaboration and open communication, but that they are also given a great deal of autonomy and freedom in their own individual roles.
Our culture is not a micro-managing environment – rather, employees are encouraged to be self-starters, to voice new ideas, and to exercise ownership in their individual roles.
As such, individual team members can leave a lasting impact and footprint within the organization – in fact, our average employee tenure is 7.7 years.
Aprimo employs a “choose your own adventure” approach to career advancement.
Staff members are not siloed into roles and for many of our teams there is no set ladder that one needs to climb to achieve growth and promotion.
Rather, we emphasize an organic approach to career development in which employees can and do frequently transition into newly created roles within their own teams or transition into other departments based on their interests in exploring new skills and responsibilities.
For additional learning and development, we recently rolled out Udemy, which is an online learning platform that employees have access to, and which features over 200,000 courses on a wide variety of business topics.
Ranked #1 in AI (Artificial Intelligence) Metadata & Search by Forrester, Aprimo sits on the cutting-edge of technology and is paving new paths forward by incorporating AI (artificial intelligence) into our product offerings.
We offer generative AI in a secure environment built for brand safety and governance. Our AI-powered content operations platform, with industry leading digital asset management (DAM) software at its core, helps to optimize the creative process and improve the user experience with better search, recommendations, categorization, and summarization.
Our AI empowers marketing teams to automate tasks, analyze data, and personalize content, ensuring scalability without sacrificing productivity.
AI automatically identifies asset characteristics and transforms them into words a human would search for. Translation, image alterations, personalization, and more are all streamlined by AI.
With our platform, marketers can efficiently produce a larger volume of content, engage customers on a personalized level, curate relevant materials, and make data-driven decisions to drive their content strategies forward.
Our AI offers up to 72% increase in discoverability and productivity, up to 61% reduction in production time, and up to 66% faster time to market.
