Are you a seasoned software engineer with a deep interest in AI? Trilogy is on the lookout for exceptional engineers to lead the charge in adopting generative AI tools both in our development process and into our products.

Join us to work on our exciting product portfolio:

TeachTap: Bringing historical figures to life using AI, offering an engaging, TikTok-like learning experience to make learning more relevant and fun.

Crossover: An AI-powered hiring platform that sifts through millions of applicants annually to find the top 1% of global talent.

Your role will focus on integrating AI into engineering practices, using AI tools to increase efficiency and solve engineering tasks like coding and testing. Based on the obtained results, you will derive recipes and playbooks to be adopted by the broader engineering team. Maintaining high-quality standards in our codebases while ensuring high leverage of AI tools across our engineering teams will be a key part of your work.

You will be an integral part of our existing engineering team, working collaboratively on our suite of products to deeply understand our environment and needs. You will have the freedom to propose and experiment with new tools and then will leverage the insights and experiences obtained to evolve our processes, advocate for new tool adoption, or even spearhead the creation of small tools, bots, and frameworks to enhance our technical setup.

Building new AI models from scratch; instead, your focus will be on leveraging and fine-tuning existing models to maximize efficiency.
Being confined to outdated technologies; we encourage an environment that thrives on dynamic tech stacks, fostering continuous innovation.

Lead Software Engineer Key Responsibilities

Drive transformative change by establishing a framework that seamlessly integrates generative AI, significantly amplifying engineering productivity.

Basic Requirements

Minimum 5 years of experience in professional software development.
Minimum 3 years either as a lead engineer reviewing the work of other engineers or as an architect making important technical decisions.
